### How I refactored and fulfilled my assignment

I utilized git hub to create and clone the assignment repository. I also used git hub to keep track of changes and version control of the code, in case I make a big mistake coding. I then used VS code to analyze and refactor the code. This is my first project, I used my lack of knowledge to learn and play with HTML and CSS commands. Every change I made, I would reference the site to learn what a tag and or function is doing. I also grouped similar id functions into classes to reduce redundencies in the code. Lastly I used outside resources, all the additional resources provided in class in conjuncion with google and w3 schools to further my knowledge and understanding of these two languages. I also expanded my knowledge on mark down to write this read me. Reference the notes in the code to discover what I learned and the changes that were made durring refactoring. Don't be afraid to let me know what I am missing. I love to learn.
